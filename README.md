# Hilda

## Description

Hilda is a debugger which combines both the power of LLDB and iPython for easier work. 

The name originates from  the TV show "Hilda", which is the best friend of 
[Frida](https://frida.re/). Both Frida and Hilda are meant for pretty much
the same purpose, except Hilda takes the more "debugger-y" approach (based on LLDB). 

Currently, the project is intended for iOS debugging, but in the future we 
will possibly add support for the following platforms as well:

* OSX
* Linux
* Android

Since LLDB allows abstraction for both platform and architecture, it should be possible to make the necessary changes
without too many modifications.

Pull requests are more than welcome üòä.

## Installation

Requirements:

* Jailbroken iOS device
* `iproxy` in PATH (`brew install libimobiledevice`)
* `debugserver` in device's PATH
    * [You can use this tool in order to obtain the binary](https://github.com/doronz88/debugserver-deploy)
    * After re-signing with new entitlements, you can put the binary in the following path: `/usr/bin/debugserver`

In order to install please run:

```shell
xcrun python3 -m pip install --user -U -e .
```

*‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that Hilda is installed on top of XCode's python so LLDB will be able to use its features.*

## How to use

### Starting shell

Simply run:
```shell
hilda PROCESS_NAME SSH_PORT
```

Please note the script assumes the target device is running an ssh server. It will try running the following for you:
```shell
ssh -p SSH_PORT root@localhost "debugserver localhost:1234 --attach=1234 &"&
```

For this to work, make sure the connected device doesn't require password for the connection (you can use
`ssh-copy-id` to achieve this).

### Commands

In order to view the list of available commands with their documentation, please run the following from within Hilda
shell:

```python
show_commands()
```

### Symbol objects

In Hilda, almost everything is wrapped using the `Symbol` Object. Symbol is just a nicer way for referring to addresses
encapsulated with an object allowing to deref the memory inside, or use these addresses as functions.

In order to create a symbol from a given address, please use:

```python
s = symbol(0x12345678)

# peek(/read) 20 bytes of memory
s.peek(20)

# write into this memory
s.poke('abc')

# jump to `s` as a function, passing (1, "string") as its args 
s(1, "string")

# monitor each time a symbol is called into console and print its backtrace (`bt` option)
s.monitor(bt=True)

s.item_size = 1  # change the size of each item_size inside `s` for derefs
s[0] = 1  # will store the value `1` into *s
s[1] = 1  # will store the value `1` into *(s+1)
```

### Globalized symbols

Usually you would want/need to use the symbols already mapped into the currently running process. To do so, you can
either access them using `symbols.<symbol-name>`. For example:

```python
x = symbols.malloc(20)
```

or just write their name as if they were in the global scope. Hilda will check if no name collision exists, and if so,
will perform the following lazily for you:

```python
x = malloc(20)

# is equivalent to:
malloc = symbols.malloc
x = malloc(20)
```

### Objective-C Classes

The same as symbols applies to Objective-C classes name resolution. You can either:

```python
d = NSDictionary.new()

# which is equivalent to:
NSDictionary = objc_get_class('NSDictionary')
d = NSDictionary.new()
```

This is possible only since `NSDictionary` is exported. In case it is not, you
must call `objc_get_class()` explicitly.

As you can see, you can directly access all the class' methods. In order to monitor each time a single one is called,
you can:

```python
objc_class.get_method('methodName:').address.monitor()
```

Viewing the the class layout can be achieved using:

```python
objc_class.show()
```

You can also monitor all method of a given class to see which is called when using:

```python
objc_class.monitor()
```

### Objective-C Objects

In order to work with ObjC objects, each symbol contains a property called
`objc_symbol`. After calling, you can work better with each object:

```python
d = NSDictionary.new().objc_symbol
d.show()  # print object layout
```

### Using snippets

Snippets are extensions for normal functionality used as quick cookbooks for day-to-day tasks of a debugger.

They all use the following concept to use:

```python
from hilda.snippets import snippet_name

# They all receive an instance of `HildaClient` which is self
snippet_name.do_domething(self)  
```

For example, XPC sniffing can be done using:

```python
from hilda.snippets import xpc_sniff

xpc_sniff.xpc_sniff_all(self)
```

This will monitor all XPC related traffic in the given process.
